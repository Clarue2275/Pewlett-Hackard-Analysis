# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
    The assignments were to determine how many employees are retiring according to their title
    and to identify how many employees are able to participate in a mentoring program. The research will help 
    provide managment with an idea of how much of the work force will leave once the retirees leave. This research will
    also give an idea of who would be able to serve as mentors to train other employees on a part-time basis.
 
## Results

    - These areas of employment make up roughly half of all retirees at 29414 and 28254 respectfully.
